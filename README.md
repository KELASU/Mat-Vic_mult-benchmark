# How to run
Since I am using VS Code we will use VS Code terminal:
first go to the makefile
write the following code/word below in the terminal in order from up to down:
```
wsl

make
```
and that will create a .out file which you can run the files by typing in one of the following in the terminal:
```
./main_test.out

./main_b_space.out

./main_b_time.out
```
# Time
to run the time complexity you input ./main_b_time.out in the terminal
for the time complexity the value I use to record the time is at 10000 since when I did 1000 I thought that the valu was too low

# Space
for the space complexity you input ./main_b_space.out in the terminal and it will keep running the program and you can pressCtrl+C to stop the program. You can check the space complexity in the task manager, here is the sample taken using 1000 as the value:

# Additional Note
I was not able to make the graph as every time I open desmos in the web browser or use other online graphing tools they keep crashin/not responding when I try to plot the graph.
