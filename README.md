# How to run
Since I am using VS Code we will use VS Code terminal:
first go to the makefile
write the following code/word below in the terminal in order from up to down:
```
wsl

make
```
and that will create a .out file which you can run the files by typing in one of the following in the terminal:
```
./main_test.out

./main_b_space.out

./main_b_time.out
```
# Time
for the time complexity the value I use to record the time is at 10000 since when I did 1000 I thought that the valu was too low
